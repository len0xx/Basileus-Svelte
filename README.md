# What is this project

Basileus is a simple blog application created with Svelte, Sapper, Express and TypeScript (and MongoDB as a database). With this application you can create an account and write posts.

### Sapper

This project was based on Sapper default template, which you can find [here](https://github.com/sveltejs/sapper)

## How to run the application

### Using `degit`

To clone this application use [`degit`](https://github.com/Rich-Harris/degit) (It is a scaffolding tool that lets you create a directory from a branch in a repository)

```bash
npx degit "len0xx/Basileus-Svelte" my-app
```

Replace `my-app` with the path where you wish to create the project.

### Running the project

Once you have created the project, install dependencies and run the project in development mode:

```bash
cd my-app
npm install # or yarn
npm run dev
```

This will start the development server on [localhost:57648](http://localhost:57648). Open it and click around.

You now have a fully functional Sapper project! To get started developing, consult [sapper.svelte.dev](https://sapper.svelte.dev).
